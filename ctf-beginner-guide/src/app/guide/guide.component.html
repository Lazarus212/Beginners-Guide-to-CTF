<h1 class="mat-h1" >Guide</h1>
<span>Staring with CTFs can be quite overwhelming for new players. Having some reference points especially in the first few events can help to decrease the barrier for entry.
<br>
  It has to be said however that this guide can provide only reference points and not definite answers on what works best for you. Mostly everything surrounding CTF-Events is highly
  subjective and dependent on personal preferences.
</span>
  <p>Most of the tips in this task have been gather from a small non-representative group of CTF players with varying degrees of experience. Especially more experienced players have some preferences or rituals that are not suitable.
  For this reason the answers have been condensed to be most suitable for beginners. </p>

    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Choosing an event can be difficult and depends mostly on personal preference. However, for the first or first few events, the best way to go is to choose an event that fulfills the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Is held online</li>
      <li>Has mostly tasks in a category that you like (e.g., Webexploitation)</li>
      <li>Optional: Has a good rating from previous years (e.g., is not too difficult and has some easy tasks)</li>
      <li>Optional: Is recommended by experienced players</li>
    </ul>
  </mat-expansion-panel>
  <br>
  <p>Choosing which event is the right one to start can be difficult. There are many CTFs that are not suited for beginners for many reasons.</p>
  <h3 class="mat-h3" style="font-weight: bold">Selecting the right event</h3>
  <p>An event can be broken down into three aspects:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Where the event is being held</li>
    <li>What is the main task category</li>
    <li>What is the rating</li>
  </ol>
  <p>These aspects are not a definitive list of what to look for in events. There are different aspects that can be relevant, for example, the date and length of an event.</p>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">1. Where the event is being held</h3>
  <p>Most of the events fall into one of two categories:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Onsite events</li>
    <li>Online events</li>
  </ol>
  <p>For beginners, it is most likely the best option to choose an event that is held online, as it doesn't require the commitment to travel somewhere.
    <br>
    Another benefit of online events is that they usually don't require a participation fee.
    <br>
    <br>
    There are, however, scenarios where it can be a bonus to participate onsite, yet these are mostly when you have participated in at least one event and already know that CTFs are fun for you.</p>
  <p>A honorable mention for online CTFs is <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/login?redirect=/practice">picoCTFs picoGym</a> they provide a platform where every task of previous CTFs
    is playable at all times. This is a great place to see how tasks are structured and what a live CTF can look like</p>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">2. What is the main task category</h3>
  <p> There are many categories in which a task can be placed; sometimes it is not clear from which category it is, as it combines multiple categories.
    <br>
    A great source to see the different categories is <a href="https://ctf101.org/">ctf101</a>. Mostly every category can be found with some corresponding tasks and tools.
    <br>
    <br>
    However, in the events, there are mostly not only tasks from one category but instead a focus on some. Choosing the right category is something that everyone has to do for themselves.
    There is no harder or easier category that can be recommended for starting; it always highly depends on your personal preference and/or experience. </p>
  <p>A recommendation for finding a category you like is to look at the tasks in <a href="https://play.picoctf.org/login?redirect=/practice">picoCTFs picoGym</a> there most of the categories have at least one task. </p>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">3. What is the rating</h3>
  <p>
    The weight or rating of an event is primarily used by <a href="https://ctftime.org/rating-formula/">CTFTime</a> for determining the points a team can get by participating in this event.
    However, the rating/weight of an event can also be used as a <strong>rough estimate</strong> for how difficult it is. This weight is only a rough estimate because the weight is determined by the
    participating players after the event is finished and is only directly related to the previous iteration of the event. For this reason, many new events don't have a rating yet.
    Overall, it can be said that the rating is only a minor aspect of choosing an event.

      <mat-panel-title>TL;DR</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Preparing for an event is mostly dependent on the categories of tasks for that event. However, there are some general things that can be set up in advance:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Having the right operating system (e.g., some kind of Linux distribution if needed)</li>
      <li>Having the right tools installed (some resources include: <a href="https://ctf101.org/">ctf101.org</a> and <a
        href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">Kali tools</a>)</li>
      <li>Looking at Writeups from previous instances of the event (those can be found at <a href="https://ctftime.org/">CTFTime.org</a></li>
    </ul>
  </mat-expansion-panel>
  <br>
  <p>Preparing for an event is arguably the most important step, or at least one of the most important steps. The preparation can be varying a fair bit depending on the category of tasks.</p>
  <p>Nevertheless, there are some general steps that can be taken that apply to most of the categories.</p>
  <p>Those preparations may include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Setting up a Linux distribution</li>
    <li>Installing the needed tools</li>
    <li>Looking at Writeups</li>
  </ol>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">1. Setting up a Linux distribution</h3>
  <p>This step is not strictly necessary for participating in an event; however, it is highly recommended to use some kind of specialized Linux distribution.</p>
  <p>There are multiple distributions that can be used; arguably the most popular of those is <a href="https://www.kali.org/">Kali Linux</a>. This distribution is optimized for hacking, with some of the most commonly used tools pre-installed.
    Furthermore, it is the most beginner-friendly in this field. There are some alternatives that can also be used. </p>
  <p>Those alternatives include:</p>
  <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Parrot Linux</h4>
  <p><a href="https://www.parrotsec.org/">Parrot Linux</a> contains the same tools as Kali Linux. However, it is less demanding in terms of hardware and has a clearer UI. Additionally, it focuses more on anonymity on the internet.</p>
  <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Black Arch</h4>
  <p><a href="https://blackarch.org/">Black Arch</a> is used as a pure hacking and pentesting operating system. Contrary to Kali or Parrot, it is not designed for everyday use. The main drawback of this OS is that it is not
    really beginner-friendly as it is only window- and console-based. An advantage is that it has many tools pre-installed and is very light on hardware requirements. </p>
  <h4 style="font-weight: bold">Backbox</h4>
  <p><a href="https://www.backbox.org/">Backbox</a> main focus is on security auditing. Overall, it is relatively similar to Parrot Linux, with fewer demands on hardware.</p>
  <p>There are many more distributions that can be considered; those can be found on various forums and blog articles, for example on
    <a href="https://hackedyou.org/top-10-linux-distros-for-hacking-pentesting/">hackedyou.org</a>.</p>


  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">2. Installing the needed tools</h3>
  <p>This point is highly dependent on the chosen category and personal preferences. Similar to the Linux distributions, there are many options that cover the same functionality. The best site for looking at commonly used tools
    is <a href="https://ctf101.org/">ctf101.org</a>, where most of the most commonly used tools are listed by category.</p>
  <p>Additionally, many tools come pre-installed on the above-mentioned Linux distributions. For example, in Kali Linux, those can be found on their
    <a href="https://www.kali.org/tools/">tools documentation</a> site. They already cover the majority of the needed functionality.
  </p>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">3. Looking at Writeups</h3>
  <p>After nearly every event, some participating teams create Writeups for the tasks that they have solved. Some of them are a great way to get inspiration for new approaches to solutions or for learning new things to look out for. </p>
  <p>There are two possible ways to find Writeups:</p>
  <h4>1. Looking at a team website/ repository</h4>
  <p>Many of the top CTF teams have a website or a GitHub repository where they upload their Writeups. This method is good for looking at different categories and events. However, it can be difficult to find a relevant one. </p>
  <h4>2. Looking at previous events</h4>
  <p>A easier method is to look at previous events, especially if they are the same. Often, the tasks are similar to previous instances. CTFTime provides a great source for those as the Writeups as they are linked to a specific task.
    If an event has been held before, it can be beneficial to look at those Writeups. Alternatively, events with similar tasks can be looked at. </p>

      <mat-panel-title>TL;DR</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>Everyone has their own style of solving tasks. However, there are some hints that can be especially helpful for inexperienced players. Those include which tasks should be solved first and what to do when stuck on a task. </p>
    <h3>Which task to solve first</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Some events have a kind of warm-up task; it is good to start with this.</li>
      <li>After that, solve tasks in the preferred category</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>What to do when stuck on a task</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>If playing in a team, talk to other team members</li>
      <li>Look at previous Writeups of similar problems</li>
      <li>Taking regular breaks</li>
      <li>Do other tasks first</li>
      <li>If nothing works, skip the task and look at the solution or Writeup afterward</li>
    </ul>
  </mat-expansion-panel>
  <br>
  <p>Playing a CTF event can be relatively stressful, especially for the first few times. However, there are some tips and tricks that can help. Those include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>How to choose tasks to play</li>
    <li>What to do when getting stuck on a task</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">1. How to choose the tasks to play</h3>
  <p>Choosing the first task in an event can be difficult for new players. Luckily, some events have warm-up tasks that are relatively easy to solve and can provide some early points. Unfortunately, not every event provides these.
    Additionally, they are not always obvious to find. Some of them have a tag named welcome or have some other name related to "welcoming" the players to the event. Nevertheless, when no such task is provided, the normal selection strategy
    described below can be used.</p>
  <p>There are many strategies that can be used for selecting the tasks to play. The most common is simply looking at every task and starting with the ones that can be solved easily. There are some players who prefer starting with the hardest
    tasks. For beginners, the best strategy is to start with easy tasks, as it is the most fun if points can be collected and tasks can be solved completely. Additionally, the number of tasks to look at can be further reduced if it is already
    known which category is preferred.</p>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">2. What to do when getting stuck on a task</h3>
  <p>It is always frustrating when a task cannot be solved. There are some general tips that can be used. Those include asking other team members, looking at Writeups from similar tasks, taking regular breaks, doing other tasks first, and in the
    worst-case, skip the task.</p>

  <h4>Ask other team members</h4>
  <p>This is the first approach when playing for a team. Most of the time, there are some players with different specialties; this can help to expand the view on the problem. However, it is not advised to ask in forums like Stack Overflow.</p>

  <h4>Looking at previous Writeups from similar tasks</h4>
  <p>Looking at similar problems can sometimes lead to a new idea for a solution. The flaw with this approach is that Writeups for the specific tasks have to be known or searched for, which can cost a lot of time. This approach is
    only really viable if a Writeup is already known. In the best case, suitable Writeups have already been found in the preparation stage.</p>

  <h4>Taking regular breaks</h4>
  <p>This is more general advice. It is only possible to concentrate on a specific task for a set amount of time; this varies from person to person. Some players set timers for breaks; this is also advisable for beginners.</p>

  <h4>Do other tasks first</h4>
  <p>When working on a task for a long time, there is a high chance that some details can be missed. For this reason, it can be helpful to concentrate on another task first and return at a later time. Sometimes other seemingly unrelated tasks can lead to
    a possible solution that was previously not obvious.</p>

  <h4>Skip the task</h4>
  <p>If none of the approaches work, it can be good to skip a task. Sometimes the tasks are too difficult to solve at the current level of experience. In this case, it is better to collect points from other, easier tasks and look at the solution or
    Writeup afterward.</p>

  <p>All of these approaches are just suggestions, as everyone has a different way of solving problems. Nevertheless, those are the ones most commonly used.</p>

      <mat-panel-title>TL;DR</mat-panel-title>
    </mat-expansion-panel-header>
    <p>There are some things that can or should be done after an event. Those include: </p>
    <ul>
      <li>Looking at Writeups from other players</li>
      <li>Create Writeups for solved tasks</li>
      <li>Optional: Create or update the templates</li>
    </ul>
  </mat-expansion-panel>
  <p>Most players don't do follow-ups for past events, even though it can be really helpful for other events. Nevertheless, this step is mostly optional, especially for beginners. Those follow-up steps can include:</p>
  <ol>
    <li>Looking at solutions from other players</li>
    <li>Creating Writeups for solved tasks</li>
    <li>Creating or updating templates</li>
  </ol>
  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">1. Looking at solutions from other players</h3>
  <p>This step can be very helpful in the case of failed tasks. Sometimes the tasks are too difficult to solve at the current level of experience. In this case, looking at the solution, can provide a way to learn for future events.
    It can even be good for successfully solving tasks, as there are often many ways to solve the problems. </p>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">2. Creating Writeups</h3>
  <p>Creating Writeups for solved tasks can be laborious. Nevertheless, it pays off in the future, as the solution to a task doesn't get lost. The Writeups don't necessarily have to be published; it is sufficient to just write them for oneself or the team.
    If they get published, it can help other players improve and sometimes lead to an exchange of solutions with other players.</p>

  <h3 style="font-weight: bold">3. Creating or updating templates</h3>
  <p>This step is similar to the previous one, as it involves recording the solution to tasks for future usage. The main difference is that here some more generic information should be used that can be even more suitable for future use.
  </p>

  <p>Overall, the step of following up after an event is very helpful for future events. Especially considering that most of the experience gathered in the event will be lost if it is not written down somewhere.</p>
